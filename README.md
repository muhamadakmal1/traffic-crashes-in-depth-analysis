# 🚗 Traffic Crashes: In-Depth Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of traffic crash data, performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to uncover patterns, contributing factors, and high-risk zones related to road accidents through insightful visualizations and statistical summaries.

## 📊 Overview

Road accidents pose a serious threat to public safety and result in significant economic losses. This analysis dives deep into crash datasets to understand:

- When and where crashes are most likely to happen
- Common causes of accidents
- Influence of weather, lighting, and road conditions
- Distribution of crashes by time, location, and type

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas** – Data manipulation
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – Data visualization
- **numpy** – Numerical computations

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified peak hours and days with the highest crash rates.
- Analyzed the role of lighting and weather conditions in crash severity.
- Highlighted accident hotspots using geospatial visualization (if applicable).
- Compared crash counts by driver demographics and vehicle types.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhamadakmal1/traffic-crashes-in-depth-analysis.git
   cd traffic-crashes-in-depth-analysis

Future Enhancements
Convert the notebook into a Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration.

Integrate real-time crash datasets (e.g., using APIs).

Use clustering or predictive models for crash severity forecasting.
